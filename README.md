# DiscordCrasher
This repository contains the code of a newly found discord group crasher, how this exploit works is it abuses an endpoint that isnt ratelimited. Which is the endpoint to change the group channel name, spam the fuck out of that and when the client renders the updates, you will crash.
# Credits #
Trial - finding the exploit<br />
Yaekith - improving the code and implementing it into mist<br />
Kate - making the code in JS<br />

# Caution #
A person named Aldaz skidded this crash exploit from trial and is now claiming clout for it, skids don't deserve clout. He's also trying to get it patched, so now it's a race to get it patched first because of him.
