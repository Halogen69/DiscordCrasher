# DiscordCrasher
This repository contains the code of a newly found discord group crasher, how this exploit works is it abuses an endpoint that isnt ratelimited. Which is the endpoint to change the group channel name, spam the fuck out of that and when the client renders the updates, you will crash.
# Credits #
Trial - finding the exploit<br />
Yaekith - improving the code and implementing it into mist<br />
Kate - making the code in JS<br />

# Caution #
A person named Aldaz skidded this crash exploit from trial and is now claiming clout for it, skids don't deserve clout. He's also trying to get it patched, so now it's a race to get it patched first because of him.

# How to use #
You can put this in a folder and use nodejs to run it using 'node code.js' <br />
Or you can put the code from code.js into your console on discord (CTRL SHIFT I TO OPEN) <br />
Don't forget to replace 'insertyourusertokenhere' with your own user token and the groupID with an actual group chat id before running.
